# Basics
This basic php script checks for proxy then if none found redirects to actual page. So just put the index.php page in the root dir then build your site.
# Reasons
Reduce trolls
Reduce spamming from bots
Block users trying to bypass ipbans.

# Future Updates
In future updates I am hoping to have it set some type of id in a php session so they can not just bypass this page by going to the dir or page the main site is contained in.
Auto ban proxy IP's.
